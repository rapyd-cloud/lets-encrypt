Your ZeroSSL SSL certificate will remain valid for 90 days. 

One month before expiration the system will automatically request a certificate update.  

To perform updates manually at any time, use the **Update Now** button at the add-onâ€™s panel.  

Also, the deployed domain names list can be adjusted later with the **Configure** button.
